### **Code Review:**

1. **Input Validation:**
   - You’ve implemented robust input validation, which is crucial for a good user experience.
     It ensures the program doesn’t crash due to invalid inputs.
   - Consider also flushing the input buffer to clear any remaining invalid input, which can help avoid infinite loops
     during input prompts.

2. **Switch Statement:**
   - Your switch statement is clean and handles operations efficiently.
   - To make it even clearer, you could define your arithmetic functions separately and call them from within the switch case.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The replay functionality is a nice touch, allowing users to continue using the calculator without restarting the program.
   - You could also consider providing a summary of operations before asking if the user wants to continue.

4. **Code Readability:**
   - Your use of comments throughout the code helps with readability. It makes it easy for someone else (or yourself later)
     to understand your thought process.

5. **Functionality:**
   - You could enhance the calculator by allowing for more complex calculations or even supporting additional operations (like modulus).
   - You might also consider adding a history feature that shows the past calculations.

### **Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Refactor to Functions:**
   - Consider creating separate functions for each arithmetic operation. This can improve modularity and make your code cleaner.

2. **Error Handling Enhancements:**
   - While you handle division by zero, you could also extend this to handle cases where the user enters non-numeric characters
     for the numbers, ensuring that the user receives clear feedback.

3. **User Interface Improvements:**
   - If you feel comfortable, you could explore creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Qt or SFML in the future,
     to expand your skills further.
